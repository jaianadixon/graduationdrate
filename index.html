  <h1>2014 Graduation Rate</h1>
<a href="Blacks.html">Balcks Graduation Rate</a>
  <a href="Hispanics.html">Hispanic Graduation Rate</a>

<hr>
  <p>
    <strong>For DC schools, Blacks have the highest graduation rate based on the mean. But based on the Median, Hispanics have the highest graduation rate. The Hispanics data is more scattered and have a higher standard deviation and there are a small number of schools who report data for Hispanics.</strong>

  <h1> Conclusion</h1>
  <p>
    In conclusion Blacks have the highest graduation rate based on the mean.Based on the Median and the Hispanics have a more scattered data. My data supports my claim because if you look at the data you can see that Blacks have a higher mean out of the four but Hispanics have a higher median.
